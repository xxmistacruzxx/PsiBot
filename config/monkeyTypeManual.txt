The PsiBot MonkeyType Module is designed to display various data from the typing game website, MonkeyType.
Meaning, this module will only be useful if you use MonkeyType and have an account.

To get started, you'll first need to make an ApeKey for your MonkeyType account. This can be done by...
1. Goto MonkeyType.com
2. Hit the settings button (gear icon)
3. Scroll to the bottom section called "danger zone"
4. Hit the open button to the right of "ape keys"
5. Hit "Generate new key" in the top right of the menu, give it a name, and continue.
6. Copy the ApeKey generated, put it aside, and continue.
7. Hit the check box to the left of your newly created ApeKey
Now, you're all done with what needs to be done on MonkeyType's website!

The last thing to do is type `!prefix!setapekey` followed by your ApeKey you just created.
Now, you're be able to use the other MonkeyType commands to display various stats, personal bests, and results!
